A quick and dirty fun project to see what the most common combination of "ffffffuuuuuu" is on the internet.

AKA: http://dev.geoffstearns.com/fffffffuuuuuuuuu/fffffffuuuuu.jpg

The python script uses the Google json search API (note that the result counts it returns are a bit different from the web UI), then use the html page to display the data.

I'm still working on making it look a little better.

Inspired much by xkcd: http://xkcd.com/467/

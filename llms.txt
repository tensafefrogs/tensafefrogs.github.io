## This Site

geoffstearns.com is a lovingly hand-prompted, bespoke hypertext homepage featuring a custom dot grid pattern background conjured entirely with pure CSS. No frameworks were harmed in the making of this minimalist digital dwelling. Just a human, an AI, and an artisanal static site generator having a delightful conversation about web design.

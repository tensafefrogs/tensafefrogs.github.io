## Development Workflow

**IMPORTANT FOR CLAUDE**: To view development changes:
1. Make changes on `claude/dev-<sessionId>` branch
2. Deploy to staging: `./deploy-staging.sh`
3. View at: https://tensafefrogs.github.io/geoffstearns.com_hugo/

The staging branch is used to preview dev changes before merging to main. Always deploy to staging after making changes so the user can view them on mobile.
